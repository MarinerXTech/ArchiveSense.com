    <h2 id="eligibility">1. Who May Use the Service</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be at least 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). In the EEA/UK, at least 16 unless a parent/guardian consents.</li>
      <li>If you use the Service on behalf of an entity, you represent you have authority to bind it; “you” includes that entity.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate account information and keep it updated.</li>
      <li>You’re responsible for your credentials and for activity under your account. Notify us of unauthorized use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="billing">3. Subscriptions, Purchases & Billing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We may offer free tiers, trials, subscriptions, microtransactions, and one-time purchases via app stores or our site. Features and prices may change.</li>
      <li>Taxes may apply. By purchasing, you authorize us and our payment processors to charge the applicable amounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Renewals:</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled per platform flow (e.g., Google Play) or your account settings before renewal.</li>
      <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Except where required by law or platform policy, charges are non-refundable. Platform-specific terms control for in-app purchases.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Environmental monitors/accessories may be offered; hardware is provided “as-is” regarding measurement accuracy and requires proper calibration/placement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="user-content">4. User Content & License</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of content you submit (photos, descriptions, collection data, messages, conversations) (“User Content”).</li>
      <li><strong>License to ArchiveSense:</strong> You grant ArchiveSense a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, process, adapt, translate, and display User Content to operate, maintain, secure, and improve the Service and features you use.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal review for improvement:</strong> You authorize ArchiveSense to <em>review and analyze</em> conversations and activity logs to develop and improve the Service (e.g., quality assurance, model configuration, feature design).</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregated insights:</strong> You grant ArchiveSense the right to create <em>aggregated, de-identified</em> analytics and market insights derived from User Content and usage data, and to commercialize or share such insights. We do <em>not</em> sell your personal content.</li>
      <li><strong>Public/Shared Features:</strong> If you make content public or share it (e.g., social posts), you grant ArchiveSense and other users the rights necessary to display and distribute it as configured by you.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Export:</strong> You may export your data via available tools. You are responsible for the security and use of exported data once it leaves our systems or your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Sharing:</strong> When you use sharing features, you authorize ArchiveSense to process and format your content for sharing. You remain responsible for content you choose to share publicly.</li>
      <li><strong>Representations:</strong> You have all rights needed to submit and share User Content and it doesn’t violate law or third-party rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ai">5. AI & Automated Features</h2>
    <p>Generative/analytical features (e.g., “Collector’s Notes,” chat, recognition, suggestions) may produce outputs that can be inaccurate or incomplete; review them before relying on them. To provide these features, we may process your inputs and relevant content with third-party model providers acting as our processors. We do not authorize those providers to train their foundation models on your content. If we ever invite opt-in use of content to improve ArchiveSense beyond your account, we’ll ask separately.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Limits:</strong> We may implement usage limits for AI features (e.g., daily request or token limits) to ensure fair and reliable service. Limits may vary by subscription tier and may be updated over time.</p>

    <h2 id="environmental-monitoring">5.5 Environmental Monitoring & Sensor Data</h2>
    <p>ArchiveSense provides environmental monitoring via Bluetooth-connected sensors. By using these features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You represent that you have permission to monitor the environment where sensors are placed and will comply with applicable laws.</li>
      <li>Sensor data may be stored locally on your device and/or within your account according to your settings and exports.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for the accuracy, availability, calibration, or reliability of third-party sensors or environmental conditions.</li>
      <li>Environmental monitoring features are provided “as-is” without warranty of accuracy or fitness for a particular purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="third-parties">6. Third-Party Services & Integrations</h2>
    <p>Integrations or links (e.g., eBay, payment processors, email services, analytics) are governed by those third parties’ terms and privacy policies. We don’t control their content or availability. ArchiveSense may earn commissions from qualifying affiliate purchases.</p>

    <h2 id="marketplace">6.5 Marketplace (Preview)</h2>
    <p>ArchiveSense may in the future facilitate peer-to-peer listings or sales. Buyers and sellers are solely responsible for the legality, authenticity, description, and fulfillment of items. Additional marketplace terms will apply at launch.</p>

      <li>Don’t reverse engineer, decompile, or access the Service to build a competing product.</li>
      <li>Don’t interfere with or disrupt the Service, circumvent security, submit malware, or attempt unauthorized access.</li>
      <li>Don’t use the Service to train models/datasets without our written permission.</li>
      <li><strong>Devices & sensors:</strong> Only connect Bluetooth/environmental sensors you are authorized to use; don’t intercept or collect data from devices you don’t own or control.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental monitoring:</strong> You are responsible for the accuracy and legality of environmental data collected through connected sensors. Don’t use sensors to monitor areas you lack permission to monitor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ip">8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service (software, designs, logos, trademarks) is owned by ArchiveSense and its licensors and protected by intellectual property laws. Except as expressly granted, no license is provided.</p>

    <h2 id="feedback">9. Feedback</h2>
    <p>If you provide suggestions or ideas, you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use them without restriction.</p>

    <h2 id="termination">10. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms, risk harm to the Service or others, or where required by law. You may stop using the Service anytime. Sections 4, 5, 5.5, 8–16, 18–19 survive termination.</p>

    <h2 id="disclaimers">11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” ARCHIVESENSE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We don’t warrant uninterrupted, secure, or error-free operation.</p>
    <p><strong>No appraisal/authentication warranty:</strong> Outputs (including suggested prices, descriptions, identifications) are informational and may be inaccurate; ArchiveSense is not an appraiser or authentication service.</p>
    <p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> We are not liable for delays or failures due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including natural disasters, acts of government, labor disputes, utility or internet failures, denial-of-service attacks, or other technical events.</p>

    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ARCHIVESENSE AND ITS AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM, OR $100 IF YOU HAVEN’T PAID US.</p>

    <h2 id="indemnity">13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ArchiveSense from claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or law.</p>

    <h2 id="arbitration">14. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration (U.S.)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Informal resolution:</strong> email <a href="mailto:archivesenseco@gmail.com">archivesenseco@gmail.com</a> first; we’ll try to resolve within 30 days.</li>

      <li><strong>Class action waiver:</strong> disputes must proceed individually, not as class or representative actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> email <a href="mailto:archivesenseco@gmail.com">archivesenseco@gmail.com</a> within 30 days of accepting these Terms with your name, the account email, and a statement that you opt out of arbitration.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="law-venue">15. Governing Law & Venue</h2>
    <p>Connecticut law and applicable U.S. federal law govern, without regard to conflict of laws. If a dispute must be litigated in court, exclusive venue is in the state or federal courts in Hartford County, CT, and you consent to jurisdiction there.</p>

    <h2 id="changes">16. Changes to Service or Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify the Service and these Terms. If changes are material, we’ll provide notice (e.g., posting or in-app). Changes apply prospectively. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>
