# Images for Materials Preservation Article

This directory should contain the following images to enhance the article:

## Required Images

### 1. deterioration-process.png
- **Purpose**: Show the three main factors driving deterioration
- **Content**: Diagram showing temperature, humidity, and pollutants interacting
- **Style**: Clean, scientific diagram with arrows and labels
- **Size**: 800x400px recommended

### 2. wood-acid-emission.png
- **Purpose**: Illustrate how wood releases acids
- **Content**: Cross-section of wood showing acid molecules (acetic/formic) being released
- **Style**: Molecular diagram or simplified chemical representation
- **Size**: 600x300px recommended

### 3. pvc-degradation.png
- **Purpose**: Show PVC degradation process
- **Content**: Chemical structure of PVC breaking down, releasing HCl and plasticizers
- **Style**: Chemical diagram showing molecular changes
- **Size**: 600x300px recommended

### 4. microclimate-control.png
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate proper storage setup
- **Content**: Container with silica gel, activated carbon, and proper materials
- **Style**: Technical illustration or photo of setup
- **Size**: 800x400px recommended

## Image Guidelines

- Use consistent color scheme matching the site (warm beiges, browns, accent colors)
- Keep text readable and professional
- Use clear, simple diagrams that non-technical readers can understand
- Consider using icons or symbols to represent chemical processes
- Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed but clear)

## Alternative Sources

If creating custom images isn't feasible, consider:
- Using stock scientific illustrations
- Creating simple diagrams with tools like Canva or Draw.io
- Using museum/conservation resources that allow educational use
- Commissioning simple technical illustrations

## Fallback

If images aren't available, the article will still function perfectly with the text content and the materials comparison section provides visual guidance through the color-coded safe/unsafe materials lists.
